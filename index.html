        <p class="text">
          If you've spent hours daydreaming out your office window, dreaming of
          endless open roads and ceaseless adventure, there's a simple solution:
          Pack up and go. Few things are more humbling or magical than
          traveling—we mean that both metaphorically and physically—out of your
          comfort zone.
          <br />
          <br />
          Traveling is all well and good, but sticking around in a foreign
          country for a while is even more adventurous and advantageous, as you
          master the trials and tribulations of everyday life. Everywhere you
          go, people will hear your funny accent and want to start a
          conversation with you. It's a fast track to meeting people and feeling
          more interesting and exotic than you could've imagined if you never
          left these shores.

          <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Bicycle aficionado or not, you have probably encountered the terms
          biking and cycling many times. Biking and cycling normally involves
          the same thing a bicycle. If these two words supposedly have
          interchangeable meanings, then why do some people prefer to use one
          over the other? In this article, we break down the differences and put
          iron out the confusion once and for all!
          <br />
          <br />
          Cycling professionals usually use both of these words depending on the
          context. Cyclists and bikers can both ride bicycles, but what about
          other cycle types like unicycles and tricycles? Before we talk about
          the different ways these two words are used, let us first take a brief
          look at the history of the bicycle.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is a recreational and competitive sport where a pilot
          flies using a fabric gliding wing with no rigid structure. The pilot
          sits in a harness suspended by several lines that attach to the wing
          to support the weight of the pilot and maintain the shape of the wing.
          <br />
          <br />
          The wing also has an opening in the front of the airfoil that allows
          air to enter the structure to inflate the wing. This internal pressure
          is also what makes the wing maintain its shape. You can see this on
          the leading edge of the wing where there are holes for the entry of
          the air.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is usually associated with warm ocean beaches like those found
          in the U.S. states of Hawaii and California, and countries such as
          Australia. Surfers, however, do not limit themselves to warm weather
          or ocean waves. Surfers dust a foot of snow off their surfboards to
          chase waves off the coast of Antarctica. They trek through jungles to
          pristine beaches in Southeast Asia.
          <br />
          <br />
          The concept is simple, but the practice is not. Surfers paddle or are
          towed in to the surf line, the area of open water where waves break as
          they near a coast. There, surfers sit on their boards and watch waves
          roll in to shore. Experienced surfers assess several different
          qualities in every wave.
